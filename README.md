# Decline-Curve-Analysis-on-Sample-data
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs decline curve analysis (DCA) using a hyperbolic model on historical oil production data. It demonstrates how to forecast future production based on past trends and visualize the results interactively.

ðŸ“‚ Contents
oil_decline_analysis.ipynb â€“ Main notebook performing the analysis.

sample.csv â€“ Sample dataset with historical oil production and dates.

README.md â€“ Project documentation and overview.

ðŸ“Š Project Overview
Decline Curve Analysis is a key technique in reservoir engineering and production forecasting. This notebook focuses on modeling oil production decline using a hyperbolic decline curve, with the initial production rate (qáµ¢) fixed and the decline rate (D) and hyperbolic factor (b) estimated from data.

ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries Used
The project uses the following Python libraries:

pandas â€“ Data manipulation and preprocessing

numpy â€“ Numerical computations

scipy.optimize.curve_fit â€“ Non-linear curve fitting to estimate decline parameters

plotly.graph_objects â€“ Interactive plotting for visualizing actual and forecasted production trends

ðŸ“Œ Dataset
The dataset sample.csv contains two columns:

Monthly Production Date â€“ The date of the production record (monthly)

Monthly Oil â€“ Oil production value for the corresponding month

ðŸ”§ Features & Functionality
Preprocessing of time series data into monthly intervals since production start.
